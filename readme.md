Another chat app. Because the world needs as many chat apps as possible.

This is my first app created with meteor. I wanted to choose a project that would let meteor's publish/subscribe model shine. When you post a message, everyone elses chat log should update. In a normal web app, this would be hard. You would have to tell your app to continuously poll for new messages. Or use websockets. But meteor automatically syncs the local database with the main database. Basically, meteor is cool, and I want to use it to write an app.
